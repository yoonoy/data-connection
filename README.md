# Employee Database Management

This Java application allows users to manage employee data stored in a relational database. The project implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for an `Employee` table using JDBC. 

The `Employee` entity contains fields such as `id`, `name`, `position`, `salary`, and `hire_date`. The `EmployeeData` class interacts with the database, performing operations like adding, updating, retrieving, and deleting employee records.

## How to Run the Program

### Prerequisites:
1. Install java 
2. Install a database such as PostgreSQL
3. Create a database named `employee` and create the `employee`.
